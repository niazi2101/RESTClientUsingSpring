# RESTClientUsingSpring
Android REST client using Spring library

I have implemented GET, GET ALL and POST methods using Spring: https://spring.io/

All java files of acitivities are placed in a package name 'activities'.
All code is commented properly.

You might want to change starting activity by editing the manifest file.
